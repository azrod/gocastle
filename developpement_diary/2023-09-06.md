I'm working to give back more generic point system to manage points like health point, mana point, etc.

I'm create new directory `pkg/pts` to store point system package.

This package is called "pts" and it provides a point system. It defines a type called `Point` with type `int`.

```go
type Point int
```

I create lots of methods to manipulate the `Point` type, such as `Add`, `Sub`, `Set`, `Get`, `String`, `Reset` and `IsZero`.

In the `pkg/hp` package, I'm use the `Point` type to manage health point. I'm change the `HP` struct to use the `Point` type.

```diff
type HP struct {
-       Max     int
-       Current int
+       Max     *pts.Point
+       Current *pts.Point
}
```

And I'm remove `AddMax`, `AddCurrent`, `SetMax`, `SetCurrent`, `GetCurrent` and `GetMax` methods because I'm use the `Point` methods.

With the same logic as `pkg/hp`, I'm create `pkg/mp` package to manage mana point.
I'm change the CharacterState and NPCStats structs to use the new mana point system.

```diff
 type CharacterStats struct {
        (...)
        // Secondary characteristics
        // Those characteristics depend on main chars, level and gear
        HP             *hp.HP
+       MP             *mp.MP
-       MaxMP          int
-       CurrentMP      int
        PhysicalDamage int
```

```diff
type NPCStats struct {
        Dialog      string
        Hostile     bool
        Avatar      Avatar
        HP          *hp.HP
+       MP          *mp.MP
-       MaxMP       int
-       CurrentMP   int
        LootXP      int
```
