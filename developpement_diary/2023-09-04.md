Hi everyone. I'm [@azrod](https://github.com/azrod) and contributor to this great project.

I'm create new generic health point system to manage current and max health point. This is a base for this ISSUE [#25](https://github.com/zwindler/gocastle/issues/25)

First I create new directory `pkg` to store all generic package and create new subdirectory `hp` to store health point package.

This package is called "hp" and it provides a health point system with a maximum and current value. It defines a struct called "HP" which has two fields: "Max" and "Current". The package provides several methods to manipulate the "HP" struct, such as "Heal", "Damage", "Percent", "PercentString", "String", "Reset", "AddMax", "AddCurrent", "SetMax", "SetCurrent", "Set", "New", "GetCurrent", and "GetMax".

* The `Heal` method adds the given amount to the current HP and caps it at the maximum HP.
* The `Damage` method subtracts the given amount from the current HP and caps it at 0.
* The `Percent` method returns the current HP as a percentage of the maximum HP.
* The `PercentString` method returns the current HP as a percentage string.
* The `String` method returns the current and maximum HP as a string.
* The `Reset` method sets the current HP to the maximum HP.
* The `AddMax` method adds the given amount to the maximum HP.
* The `AddCurrent` method adds the given amount to the current HP.
* The `SetMax` method sets the maximum HP to the given amount.
* The `SetCurrent` method sets the current HP to the given amount.
* The `Set` method sets the maximum and current HP to the given amount.
* The `New` method returns a new HP struct with the given max and current values.
* The `GetCurrent` method returns the current HP value.
* The `GetMax` method returns the max HP value.

Finally, the package also provides a function called `Compute` which returns the computed Max value based on the given level and base value. There is also a method with the same name that sets the maximum HP to the computed value based on the given level, base value, and constitution.

I'm change the CharacterState and NPCStats structs to use the new health point system.

```diff
 type CharacterStats struct {
        (...)
        // Secondary characteristics
        // Those characteristics depend on main chars, level and gear
-       MaxHP          int
-       CurrentHP      int
+       HP             *hp.HP
        MaxMP          int
        CurrentMP      int
        PhysicalDamage int
```

```diff
type NPCStats struct {
        Dialog    string
        Hostile   bool
        Avatar    Avatar
-       MaxHP     int
-       CurrentHP int
+       HP        *hp.HP
        MaxMP     int
        CurrentMP int
        LootXP    int
```

I'm rewrite the `HandlePlayerDamage` function to use the new health point system. This generates text about the NPC's health status based on the percentage of remaining health points. The additional information is added to the combat log string that is returned by the function. The function uses a switch statement to determine the additional information based on the percentage of remaining health points.

```diff
 // HandleNPCDamage returns strings for having nice logs during combat with NPCs.
-func (npc *NPCStats) HandleNPCDamage(damageDealt int) string {
-       newHP := npc.CurrentHP - damageDealt
+func (npc *NPCStats) HandleNPCDamage() string {
+       var additionalInfo string
 
        // Here there are levels of injury
        // I want to give player additional information, but not every time!
        // only when NPC are going from above 80% live to under 80%, for example
-       var additionalInfo string
-       if newHP <= 0 { //nolint:gocritic // TODO Improve this
-               additionalInfo = fmt.Sprintf("%s is dead.", npc.Name)
-       } else if newHP > 0 && newHP <= int(0.2*float64(npc.MaxHP)) && npc.CurrentHP > int(0.2*float64(npc.MaxHP)) {
-               additionalInfo = fmt.Sprintf("%s looks barely alive.", npc.Name)
-       } else if newHP > int(0.2*float64(npc.MaxHP)) && newHP <= int(0.5*float64(npc.MaxHP)) && npc.CurrentHP > int(0.5*float64(npc.MaxHP)) {
-               additionalInfo = fmt.Sprintf("%s looks seriously injured.", npc.Name)
-       } else if newHP > int(0.5*float64(npc.MaxHP)) && newHP <= int(0.8*float64(npc.MaxHP)) && npc.CurrentHP > int(0.8*float64(npc.MaxHP)) {
-               additionalInfo = fmt.Sprintf("%s looks injured.", npc.Name)
-       } else if newHP > int(0.8*float64(npc.MaxHP)) && newHP < npc.MaxHP && npc.CurrentHP == npc.MaxHP {
-               additionalInfo = fmt.Sprintf("%s looks barely injured.", npc.Name)
+       switch {
+       case npc.HP.IsDead():
+               additionalInfo += fmt.Sprintf("%s is dead.", npc.Name)
+       // remaininghp between 80% and 100%
+       case npc.HP.IsAlive() && npc.HP.Percent() > 0.8:
+               additionalInfo += fmt.Sprintf("%s looks barely injured.", npc.Name)
+       // remaininghp between 50% and 80%
+       case npc.HP.IsAlive() && npc.HP.Percent() > 0.5:
+               additionalInfo += fmt.Sprintf("%s looks injured.", npc.Name)
+       // remaininghp between 20% and 50%
+       case npc.HP.IsAlive() && npc.HP.Percent() > 0.2:
+               additionalInfo += fmt.Sprintf("%s looks seriously injured.", npc.Name)
+       // remaininghp between 0% and 20%
+       case npc.HP.IsAlive() && npc.HP.Percent() > 0:
+               additionalInfo += fmt.Sprintf("%s looks barely alive.", npc.Name)
        }
        return fmt.Sprintf("you strike at the %s, %s's hit! %s", npc.Name, npc.Pronoun, additionalInfo)
 }
```
